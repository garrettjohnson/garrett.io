## I’m Garrett Johnson.

I’m a designer and developer living in Fresno, California.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/neverarriving), on [GitHub](https://github.com/garrettjohnson), LinkedIn, and on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/garrett_johnson).

Currently I run digital properties for [NorthPointe Church](https://www.northpointe.org/), and support [Ministry Ops](http://ministryops.com) a SaaS startup I founded.

I’ve also done work for happy clients and friends like [Sidehugs](http://sidehugs.com), a occasionally hilarious relationship blog, and [Johnson Air](https://johnsonair.net/) a [Fresno air conditioning](https://johnsonair.net/what-we-do/) company.
